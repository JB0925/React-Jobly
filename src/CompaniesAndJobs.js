/** CompaniesAndJobs Component
 * 
 * The CompaniesAndJobs component can render three different views:
 *      1). Companies: filled with Company cards with company logos
 *      2). Jobs: Filled with all available jobs and a button to apply
 *      3). Jobs for a specific company: See #2, but for only one company.
 * 
 * Variables:
 *      isLoggedIn: used to determine whether or not to protect the view from 
 *                  the user
 *      search, searchFormState: same as other forms; passing labels and initial state
 *                               to the search form 
 *      data, companyInfo addHeaderForCompany, addSearchForm:
 *              used in the useCompaniesAndJobsUpdate hook. This hook is used to determine what
 *              to show the user and which API calls to make based on the path passed in as a prop,
 *              whether we the user wants to see Company data, job data, or a specific company's jobs.
